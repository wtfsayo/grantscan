# Project Overview

GrantScan is a specialized search engine that indexes and tracks the history of grant applications across the Web3 ecosystem. By combining Opensource Observer's historical data with DAOstar's DAOIP5 standard, we create the first comprehensive, searchable database of Web3 grant applications history.

# Problem Statement

Currently in Web3:

- Grant applications are scattered across multiple platforms
- There's no way to track an applicant's previous grant attempts
- Historical application data is not standardized or easily accessible
- Grant providers can't verify applicants' previous funding history
- Duplicate grant applications across different DAOs are hard to detect

# Solution

GrantScan creates a unified view of grant application history by:

- **Opensource Observer**: Provides historical grant application data across the ecosystem
- **DAOstar x DAOIP5**: Ensures standardized format for all indexed applications
